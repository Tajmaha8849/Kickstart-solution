You are given two positive integers n and k. A factor of an integer n is defined as an integer i where n % i == 0.

Consider a list of all factors of n sorted in ascending order, return the kth factor in this list or return -1 if n has less than k factors.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 12, k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.

class Solution:
    def kthFactor(self, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        arr=[]
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            if n%i==0:
                arr.append(i)
        if len(arr)>=k:
            return arr[k-1]
        else:
            return -1
