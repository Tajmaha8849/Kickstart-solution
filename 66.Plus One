Example 1:

Input: digits = [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
Incrementing by one gives 123 + 1 = 124.
Thus, the result should be [1,2,4].
Example 2:

class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, digits: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        temp=[]
        Str=""
        for ele in digits:
            Str=Str+str(ele)            
        Str=int(Str)
        print(type(Str))
        S=Str+1              
        while(S>0):
            rem=S%10
            temp.append(rem)
            S=S//10
        temp=temp[::-1]
        return temp
